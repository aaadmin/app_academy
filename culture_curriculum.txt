Goals:
-inform students of important social issues housed in or exacerbated by the tech industry, to better understand the real social impacts of their work in the tech industry
-to save more informed students from having to explain the all the issues to their peers
-to provide resources for those who want to be supportive allies, but who donâ€™t know where to start when trying to inform themselves
-the goal is not to paint certain companies as good and certain companies as bad, but to paint a picture of the social state of the tech industry today

The how:
-every W?D5 in the main curriculum, provide a few links to culture curriculum resources related to that week's topic
-don't require the students read it, and make clear that they will never have to read or talk about these issues if they do not want to/feel comfortable doing so. These are simply meant to inform those who want to be better informed but who may not know much about the specific issue (i.e. the majority of a/A students)

WEEKLY TOPICS:
-intro to social issues in tech - benefits of/need for diversity in tech: <link2>, <link9>, <link12>, <link13>, <link14>
-women's issues: wage gap <link1>, sexual harassment in STEM <link3>, a good article that breaks down the uber harassment story, something about Sheryl Sandberg-brand feminism (i.e. white feminism vs intersectional feminism)
-citizenship/immigration, issues specifically impacting immigrants in Silicon Valley
-government surveillance: Glenn Greenwald <link10>, specific impact on Muslim Americans, tech companies' compliance with/resistance to giving government access to data
-Silicon Valley's impacts abroad: social media for political protest <link5>, refugee communication <link6>
-discrimination in the job search: <link8>
-free speech on the internet: awesome xkcd comic<link4>, the messy problem of policing hate speech, trolls <links11>
-gentrification in SF
-(potential)social benefits of tech(if you inform yourselves and commit yourself to doing good things)

Topics that need to be worked into all that somewhere:
-affirmative action, "diversity hires", and "reverse racism" <link7>
-intersectionality
-how to be a good ally(somewhere in the intro)
