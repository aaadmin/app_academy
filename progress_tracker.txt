Progress Tracker drafting:

On Saturday I spent a lot of time reading about Title IX (the federal law that prohibits sex-based discrimination in education ). On the KnowYourIX.org site there was a detailed list of common challenges activists face. They discuss some bureaucratic and legal obstacles activists face, they discuss issues of confidentiality and ethicality, being misrepresented by the media, etc. But the very last obstacle that they list is "Loneliness":

"At times it may feel like you’re standing in the middle of your quad or student center screaming. You may feel that people are not just not listening to you, but that they’re not even hearing you. Being an advocate can be incredibly lonely — and perplexing. When something is just so undeniably wrong as rape, it’s hard to understand why everyone isn’t mobilized immediately and all the time to stop it ... If you feel like you’re alone in this fight, thank you, because that’s exactly where we need you to be. We don’t need advocates against sexual violence only in the women’s studies department — we need them in the locker room, the fraternity, and in corners of the campus where no one seems to care. You’re doing an amazing job, so keep it up."

I really identified with and appreciated that. I've been playing with the idea of dropping out of App Academy, but it's reading stuff like that that keeps me coming in.
